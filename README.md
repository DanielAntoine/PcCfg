# PcCfg

## Idea
PcCfg is a lightweight desktop utility concept for quickly preparing a Windows PC with a repeatable setup profile.

The goal is to provide two simple workflows:
- **Inspect mode** to collect and review current system settings safely.
- **Apply mode** to execute a selected set of common performance and usability tweaks (power, startup, notifications, visual effects, and more).

This helps make fresh-machine setup faster, more consistent, and easier to audit.
